In a large bowl, beat together butter and cream cheese until fluffy. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer for best results.
Add in cocoa powder and vanilla extract. Beat until combined.
Beat in powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time. Add milk as necessary to make a spreadable consistency.
The frosting should be very thick and will thicken more if refrigerated.
Spread frosting onto cake and enjoy!
